<br />

    <h3>What can Jarvis do?</h3>

    <p>With Jarvis you can schedule events and access the settings of all your internet-connected appliances from the other side of the world. View and edit your various devices' scheduled events remotely by highlighting all affected accessories and choosing the new setting. Jarvis makes home automation available to virtually any homeowner.</p>

<br />

    <h3>How can Jarvis help you?</h3>

    <p>But Jarvis is more than just a single platform for monitoring and configuring all your smart devices. Having all your connected devices in a single interface also enables you to get all the diverse feedback they generate in a single dashboard. Get data on how the performance of your devices compares to similar households and how you could be saving energy and possibly making your home even more efficient. Jarvis fully integrates with your BC Hydro, Terasen Gas, and all municipal smart metering systems to get a complete picture of your house's diagnostics.</p>

<h3>Why should you choose Jarvis?</h3>

<p>While many smart device manufacturers (such as Google, Amazon, and Samsung) also offer users the management, monitoring, and some storage of short-term data storage, Jarvis is currently the only smart device connection platform that's OEM agnostic (we allow you to hook up devices from multiple providers). Only Jarvis offers cross-platform monitoring of the performance of your wifi-connected devices and an extensive inventorying of historical data. Only Jarvis' AI alogrithms give you efficiency profiles and demographic insights into your connected devices that empowers you to make the most use of these devices by giving you real-time and historical feedback.
