<h3>Q: How can I customize the insights that appear in my Insights display? </h3>
<p>
    The various insights that appear in your Insights page are generated by our AI algorithms based on the available 
    information that Jarvis has in the system. You can get better insights by customizing your settings with more 
     data. For example, the optimal temperature settings for Nest Labs thermostats are based on your geographic location, the available statistics for your neighborhood, the rooms you choose to heat and monitor, the size of the household, etc. You can enter additional data to customize your Insights in the Insights Data page.
